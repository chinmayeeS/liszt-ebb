# Warning

This directory is for application code under development by the Liszt team or collaborators.  If you are not in either of those categories, please do not expect this code to necessarily make sense or even be usable without extra information from the appropriate developers.

By contrast, code in the [`examples`](../examples) directory should be somewhat comprehensible and executable by any user.

# LICENSE

Unless otherwise specified, or permission is explicitly granted, please do not assume code in this directory is open-source.  In most cases there's no issue, but better to be safe.
