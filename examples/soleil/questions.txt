Questions

- How to call a liszt kernel with both cells and a fieldName as arguments, so
  that the operations act directly on the field with that name (needs to be
  defined before)
- Semantics of calling UpdateFlowKernels[sdx](grid.cells) when the function is
  defined as
    for sdx = 1, 4 do
        UpdateFlowKernels[sdx] = GenerateUpdateFlowKernels(grid.cells, sdx)
    end
  and then called as
    UpdateFlowKernels[sdx](grid.cells)
  Is the grid.cells redundant, as it was already specified as the first argument
  of GenerateUpdateFlowKernels?
- Add built-in method to retrieve min/max of field?
- Objects in Lua + Terra + Liszt?
