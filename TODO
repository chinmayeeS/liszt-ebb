 - integrate Will's assert code
 - modify parser to support integer constants
 - load boundary sets
 - add dot, length, builtin math functions for vectors, numbers
 - implement nested for loops over topological sets / implement syntax/semantics for loading and specifying relations
 - eventually: vector indexing in liszt kernels (allow arbitrary?), double type

 - how to implement built-in functions!
 - implement heat conduction using relational runtime!
