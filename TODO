 - add double type
 - modify parser to support integer constants
 - load boundary sets
 - add dot, length
 - add topological functions to language
 - implement nested for loops over topological sets
	- sets in nested for loops should always be related to the parameter of the next-highest loop
 - vector indexing in liszt kernels (allow arbitrary?)
